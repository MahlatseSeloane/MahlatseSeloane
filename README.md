<h1>Hi, I'm Mahlatse Seloane!</h1>
<p>I am a 26 year old, recently graduating from the University of the Witwatersrand,
having completed a degree in Bachelor of Engineering Science (in Digita Arts). I see myself as
an open-minded, analytical and engaging person, having a passion for programminig. I am eager 
to increase and expand my knowledge in the field of programming and utilize the skills i 
would gain on projects that would push an dimpact our socient in a meaningful
and positive way.</p>


<p>The projects below were  in school and were meant to expose us to many key aspects of engineering and software development. The following are two of the most important aspects:
-	The (software) engineering lifecycle: problem identification, requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing and verification, documentation and maintenance.
-	Project planning and time management.
